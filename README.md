# MWA-Final-Project-March-2023
### Final Project
### Application specifications and requirements
It’s up to you to decide your project specs and requirements. Take your time to plan your project idea, write down a short description for it, set your goals, and have a clear scope. Your project must use the following:  
* Implement a login-based system with JWT.  
* All Angular routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* All Express routes should be protected from public access by JWT (except sign-up and sign-in routes)
* Use at least one featured lazy-loaded module in the frontend and proper REST design in the backend.
* Projects must have proper UI complies with the web standards.
  
Note: Chat and products listing applications are not allowed.  
  
### Notes
* You are free to work from any comfortable spot you may choose and are not required to come or to be in the classroom. 
* I'm available to assist you any day through Teams from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, including the weekend. 
* I will create Team groups, students should be available during class hours on teams to receive calls and check on their progress.
* On the first day of the project, plan your project idea, write a description, design your DB schemas and app structure, create a daily schedule and members' tasks, and submit everything to your group on Teams.
* A daily push is required to track your code and performance. If you miss a push that will affect your final grade.
* Do not spend more than two hours on a problem, move on, or find an alternative.
      
### Final Evaluation
The last push should be performed before Tuesday 9 pm. I will meet with every team individually on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and evaluate the final project code. 
     
Good luck and happy coding!
